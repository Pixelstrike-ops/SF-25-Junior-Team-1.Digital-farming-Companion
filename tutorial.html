  <h1 class="t">MEET THE CROPS</h1>

  <h3> üåΩ MAIZE</h3>
  <p><span class="fw-bold">Scientific Name:</span> Zea mays</p>
  <p> <span class="fw-bold">Also Called:</span> Corn, The Golden Foundation</p>

  <h5>Origin</h5>
  <p> Maize was domesticated around 7,000‚Äì9,000 years ago in what is now southern Mexico. It evolved from a wild
    <br>
     grass called teosinte, which looks very different from modern corn. Ancient farmers selectively bred maize over 
     <br>
    thousands of years, turning tiny kernels into the large, juicy ears we know today. This crop was so important it
    <br>
     shaped entire civilizations like the Maya, Aztecs, and Inca.</p>

  <h5>Where  It's Grown Today</h5>
  <p> Maize is grown on every continent except Antarctica. The United States leads production, followed by China, Brazil,
    <br>
     and Nigeria. Its adaptability allows it to thrive in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. It‚Äôs grown for
     <br>
      food, feed, and industrial uses worldwide.</p>

  <h5>Growth Time / Maturity Period</h5>
  <p>Maize varieties vary, but most take between 90 and 120 days to mature. Some ‚Äúfast-maturing‚Äù types can be harvested
    <br>
     in as little as 60 days, which is useful for farmers facing short growing seasons.</p>

  <h5>Uses / Economic Importance</h5>
  <p> Maize is incredibly versatile, with uses including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Food: eaten fresh (corn on the cob), as cornmeal, popcorn, cornflakes, and baby food</li>

  <li>Animal Feed: the most widely used livestock feed</li>

  <li>Industrial Products: ethanol fuel, adhesives, biodegradable plastics, cooking oil, cosmetics, and paper products</li>

  <li>Processed Foods: corn starch, corn syrup (in soft drinks), and thickening agents in packaged foods</li>
</ol>

  <p>Maize contributes significantly to national GDP, employment, and food security in many countries.</p>

  

  <h5>Special Characteristics</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Highly adaptable to various climates</li>

    <li>Can grow in low-fertility soils with proper treatment</li>

    <li>Produces a high yield under modern farming practices</li>

  </ol>

  <h5>Mind-Blowing Facts</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Your popcorn snack is a genetic genius ‚Äî maize has more genes than humans. Yeah, that crunchy puff is literally 
      <br>
      smarter than you.</li>

    <li>Scientists worked for 4 years and pulled together 150 brainiacs just to unlock maize‚Äôs secret code. It‚Äôs the 
      <br>
      <span class="fw-bold">OG</span> of complicated plants.</li>

    <li>Popcorn kernels don‚Äôt just pop ‚Äî they explode like tiny, tasty bombs at 180¬∞C, puffing up 9,000 times bigger.
      <br>
       Your snack‚Äôs basically a mini firework show.</li>

    <li>The U.S. grows so much corn every year that if you lined up all the kernels, they would wrap around the Earth
      <br>
       nearly 20 times.</li>

    <li>Maize pollen travels over 5 miles on the wind ‚Äî it‚Äôs the plant world‚Äôs ultimate long-distance lover, stalking
      <br>
       from afar.</li>
    </ol>


  <h3> ü•î CASSAVA</h3>
  <p><span class="fw-bold">Scientific Name:</span> Manihot esculenta</p>
  <p> <span class="fw-bold">Also Called:</span> Manioc, Yuca, The Silent Survivor</p>

  <h5>Origin</h5>
  <p> Cassava originated in the tropical rainforests of South America, likely in the area around present-day Brazil 
    <br>
    and Paraguay. Indigenous peoples domesticated it thousands of years ago and developed safe ways to prepare it,
    <br>
     removing its natural toxins. It spread to Africa and Asia during European exploration and quickly became a vital 
     <br>
     food crop due to its resilience.</p>

  <h5>Where Grown Today</h5>
    <p>Cassava is primarily grown in tropical Africa, with Nigeria being the world‚Äôs largest producer, but it‚Äôs also
      <br>
       cultivated widely in Southeast Asia (Thailand, Indonesia) and South America. Its ability to grow in poor soils
       <br>
        and tolerate drought makes it crucial in food security.</p>
    

  <h5>Growth Time</h5>
   <p>Cassava‚Äôs growth cycle ranges from 8 to 24 months, depending on variety and environmental conditions. Early 
    <br>
    harvesting can be done at 8 months for tender roots, while later harvesting yields starchier tubers.</p>

  <h5>Uses / Economic Importance</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Primary source of carbohydrates for over 800 million people</li>
    <li>Used in food (garri, fufu, tapioca), animal feed, and industrial starch products</li>
    <li>Important for food security due to drought tolerance</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Special Characteristics</h5>
  <ol>
    <li>Can survive in harsh, dry conditions where other crops fail</li>
    <li>Provides a reliable food source during famine and food shortages</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Mind-Blowing Facts</h5>
  <ol><li>Cassava can survive YEARS underground before anyone even harvests it ‚Äî it‚Äôs nature‚Äôs own hidden treasure chest.</li>

  <li>Raw cassava is poisonous if not prepared right ‚Äî ancient farmers cracked the code centuries ago, turning poison 
    <br>
    into power.</li>

  <li>Cassava is so tough, it grows where almost nothing else can ‚Äî drought? Poor soil? Bring it on.</li>

  <li>Cassava starch is used to make biodegradable packaging and even cosmetics ‚Äî saving the planet while feeding millions.</li>

  <li>Millions rely on cassava as a lifeline during famines and wars ‚Äî it‚Äôs the silent hero of survival.</li>
